# Learning from Vulkan Game

This is an **educational project** created for learning low-level graphics programming with Vulkan. The project is complete as a learning exercise and is **no longer actively maintained**.

## üìö Project Purpose

This codebase serves as a **reference implementation** for:
- Modern Vulkan API usage in C
- Real-time shadow mapping techniques  
- Multi-threaded game engine architecture
- Cross-platform graphics development
- Low-level GPU programming concepts

## üéØ How to Use This Project

### For Learning
- **Study the code**: Explore the Vulkan rendering pipeline implementation
- **Run and modify**: Build the project and experiment with changes
- **Reference material**: Use as a starting point for your own graphics projects
- **Educational resource**: Understand real-world Vulkan application structure

### For Your Projects
- **Fork freely**: Create your own version without restrictions
